## Overview
This project combines deep learning and financial optimization by integrating **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** networks with **Mean-Variance Optimization (MVO)**. The goal was to predict asset returns using LSTM and construct an optimized portfolio maximizing the Sharpe Ratio.

## Key Features
- **LSTM Predictions**: Used to forecast future returns of 10 assets based on 5 years of historical price data (2020â€“2025).
- **Portfolio Optimization**: Selected the top 5 performing assets based on a 6-month moving average of predicted returns and optimized the portfolio using MVO.
